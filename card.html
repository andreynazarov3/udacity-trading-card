			<p>Sea cucumbers belong to the group of animals called echinoderms. Their closest relatives are starfish and sea urchins.
				There are over 1250 species of sea cucumbers that can be found in oceans throughout the world. Sea cucumbers usually
				live on the sea floor. Only few species live near the surface of the water. These animals are used as delicacy and as
				a part of folk medicine in Asia.</p>
